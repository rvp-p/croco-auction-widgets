The plugin Ultimate Auction Pro allows people running a shop based on WooCommerce and WordPress to create auctions. Single products can be auctioned off. The design of an auction product is similar to regular WooCommerce product. While a user in a shop adds items to his cart, here he/she can place a bid, while the auction is still active. We use Crocoblock and Elementor to design the website. To design the auctions we need additional widgets for countdown, place a bid, buy it now etcetera. Would anyone be able and willing to create such widgets?
